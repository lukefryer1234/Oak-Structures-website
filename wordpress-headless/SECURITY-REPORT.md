# üõ°Ô∏è Oak Structures WordPress Security Report

## ‚úÖ Critical Security Issues RESOLVED

### 1. **HTTPS Implementation** ‚úÖ
- **Previous**: HTTP only (port 8080) - unencrypted traffic
- **Current**: Full HTTPS with nginx reverse proxy
  - Port 443 (HTTPS) now active with SSL/TLS encryption
  - Automatic HTTP to HTTPS redirects
  - Modern SSL configuration (TLS 1.2/1.3)
  - HSTS headers for browser security
  - Self-signed certificates for development (production-ready setup)

### 2. **Apache/WordPress Port Exposure** ‚úÖ
- **Previous**: WordPress directly exposed on port 8080
- **Current**: WordPress isolated behind secure nginx proxy
  - No direct external access to WordPress container
  - All traffic filtered through security-hardened nginx
  - Rate limiting on login endpoints
  - Malicious file upload blocking

### 3. **Grafana Monitoring** ‚úÖ
- **Status**: No Grafana service found running
- **Port 3000**: Confirmed closed and secure
- **Action**: No action needed - this was a false positive

### 4. **Database Security** ‚úÖ  
- **Previous**: MySQL exposed on port 3307
- **Current**: Database completely isolated
  - No external port exposure
  - Only accessible within Docker network
  - phpMyAdmin restricted to localhost only (127.0.0.1:8081)

## üîí Security Features Implemented

### Network Security
- ‚úÖ **Nginx Reverse Proxy**: All traffic filtered through hardened proxy
- ‚úÖ **SSL/TLS Encryption**: Full HTTPS implementation
- ‚úÖ **Rate Limiting**: Login brute-force protection
- ‚úÖ **Firewall Rules**: macOS firewall enabled with restrictive rules

### Application Security  
- ‚úÖ **Security Headers**: CSP, XSS protection, clickjacking prevention
- ‚úÖ **File Upload Restrictions**: Malicious file execution blocked
- ‚úÖ **Sensitive File Protection**: wp-config.php, .env files blocked
- ‚úÖ **PHP Security**: Dangerous functions disabled
- ‚úÖ **Debug Mode**: Disabled in production configuration

### Access Control
- ‚úÖ **Private Network Only**: External internet access blocked
- ‚úÖ **Database Isolation**: No external database access
- ‚úÖ **Admin Panel Protection**: localhost-only phpMyAdmin
- ‚úÖ **Container Isolation**: Services can't be directly accessed

## üåê Current Access URLs

### ‚úÖ Secure Access
- **WordPress Site**: https://localhost (SSL encrypted)
- **Database Admin**: http://127.0.0.1:8081 (localhost only)

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Blocked Access
- **HTTP**: http://localhost (redirects to HTTPS)
- **Direct WordPress**: Port 8080 (no longer accessible)
- **External Database**: Port 3307 (blocked)

## üìã Security Checklist

### ‚úÖ Completed
- [x] HTTPS implementation with SSL certificates
- [x] HTTP to HTTPS redirects  
- [x] Database network isolation
- [x] phpMyAdmin localhost restriction
- [x] WordPress container isolation
- [x] Security headers implementation
- [x] Rate limiting on critical endpoints
- [x] Malicious file upload blocking
- [x] PHP security hardening
- [x] macOS firewall configuration
- [x] Sensitive file access blocking

### ‚è≥ Recommended Next Steps
- [ ] Complete WordPress initial setup
- [ ] Install security plugins (Wordfence, etc.)
- [ ] Change default database passwords
- [ ] Configure automated backups
- [ ] Set up monitoring and alerting
- [ ] Implement 2FA for WordPress admin
- [ ] Regular security updates schedule

## üö® Production Deployment Checklist

When moving to production, ensure:
- [ ] Replace self-signed certificates with real SSL certificates
- [ ] Update firewall rules for your specific domain
- [ ] Change all default passwords
- [ ] Configure proper DNS and domain settings
- [ ] Implement additional monitoring
- [ ] Set up automated backups
- [ ] Configure CDN for performance
- [ ] Implement additional DDoS protection

## üîß Maintenance Commands

### Start Secure Environment
```bash
cd wordpress-headless
./deploy-secure.sh
```

### Stop Services
```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.secure.yml down
```

### View Logs
```bash
# All services
docker-compose -f docker-compose.secure.yml logs

# Specific service
docker-compose -f docker-compose.secure.yml logs nginx
docker-compose -f docker-compose.secure.yml logs wordpress
```

### Update Firewall
```bash
./setup-firewall.sh
```

## üìä Security Metrics

### Before Security Implementation
- **HTTP Only**: ‚ùå Unencrypted traffic
- **External Database**: ‚ùå Port 3307 exposed  
- **Direct WordPress**: ‚ùå Port 8080 exposed
- **No Rate Limiting**: ‚ùå Brute force vulnerable
- **No Security Headers**: ‚ùå XSS/clickjacking vulnerable

### After Security Implementation  
- **HTTPS Only**: ‚úÖ All traffic encrypted
- **Isolated Database**: ‚úÖ Internal network only
- **Proxied WordPress**: ‚úÖ Nginx security layer
- **Rate Limited**: ‚úÖ Brute force protected
- **Security Headers**: ‚úÖ Multiple attack vectors blocked

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

1. **Certificate Warnings**: Browser warnings for self-signed certificates are normal in development
2. **Local Network Only**: External internet access is intentionally blocked for security
3. **WordPress Setup**: Complete setup at https://localhost (accept certificate warning)
4. **Password Security**: Change all default passwords before production use
5. **Regular Updates**: Keep WordPress, plugins, and containers updated

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- **Certificate Warnings**: Click "Advanced" ‚Üí "Proceed to localhost" in browser
- **Service Won't Start**: Check logs with `docker-compose logs [service-name]`
- **Connection Refused**: Ensure all containers are running with `docker ps`
- **WordPress Redirects**: This is normal during initial setup

### Support Commands
```bash
# Check service status
docker ps

# View nginx logs for SSL issues
docker logs oak-structures-nginx

# Restart specific service
docker-compose -f docker-compose.secure.yml restart nginx

# Check firewall status (macOS)
sudo /usr/libexec/ApplicationFirewall/socketfilterfw --getglobalstate
```
